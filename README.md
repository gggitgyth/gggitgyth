👋 Hi, I’m @gggitgyth
👀 I’m interested in everything and nothing
🌱 I’m currently learning Machine Learning and Python. I created this repo to document my learnings as progress.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a kaggle project
📫 If you are interested in collaboration, or join me in a study group to meet regularly, please feel free to reach me @ gggitgyth@gmail.com

Happy Learning!
